We'll be using Azure Table Storage for our data store.

Azure Table Storage is a NoSQL data storage service that provides a key/attribute store with a schema-less design. 
It is designed for storing large amounts of structured, non-relational data. Azure Table Storage is highly scalable, allowing for massive data storage and fast access times, making it ideal for applications requiring flexible data schemas, such as web applications, IoT, and logging systems.

Key Features:
- **Schema-less Design**: Supports a flexible data model, allowing each entity to have different properties.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large volumes of data and high transaction rates.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the storage you use, making it an economical choice for large datasets.
- **High Availability**: Built-in replication ensures data durability and availability.
- **Simple Query Model**: Supports OData-based queries for efficient data retrieval.
